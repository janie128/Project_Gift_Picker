# Data Science Project: Gift Recommendation
## Gift Recommendation System Based on Customer Reviews
  
Choosing a perfect gift is difficult. We usually browse through product descriptions in hopes of finding something suitable. However, I believe that customer reviews more realistically represent a product, yet a comprehensive evaluation of all reviews would take far too much time. Therefore, I propose to build a gift recommendation system, based on customer reviews.  

This project is in its exploratory stage.  

### File Descriptions:
`exploratory_analysis.R` contains an R script with preliminary analysis of review data, along with examples cases and the script for accessing Amazon API and web scraping to obtain that data.  
  
### Data Source:
A detailed description of data sources can be found [here](data_source.md).
